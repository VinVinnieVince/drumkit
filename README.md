# drumkit

My attempt at creating an online drumkit via JS.

Inspired by Wes Bos's Javascript 30 - Tutorial 1

Code is different to one found in tutorial as I wanted to approach it myself first before looking at the tutorial's approach.

In the future, I plan to make a 'hip-hop' version (same code, diff sounds).
